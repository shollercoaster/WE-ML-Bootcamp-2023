Class notes:

Bridge card game: players of the game are worst than worst programmers, yet people have written PhD theses on just one aspect of the game

- population = given sample size / total possible datapoints
- Curse of Dimensionality = 
	- each feature (a dimension) within constraints gets multiplied to form all possible datapoints, so we need humongous data to accurately represent the population, but 1billion datapoints in 10 dimensions represents about 10 ** (-14) of the actual data
	- the training data isnt an actual representative of the population
- could follow letters followed by other letters, bigrams trigrams, once we know the initial 2 letters of a word for eg
- given statistical context, machine translation solved by google because corpus of data (relevant data through articles)
- machine translation made easy by checking combinations of valid words in diff languages when we have combinations of particular phrases that come together
- read this https://norvig.com/mayzner.html
- most frequent english letters in words: ETAOIN SRHDLCU

- function = NAMED piece of computation
- functional programming = composing functions in programs 
- strings are monoids
- rules for such composition:
	- applying mathematical ideas of abstraction and generalization
	- associativity = imp, commutativity not general because subtraction prohibited\
	- has an identity (there exists i such that for all x, i.x = x)
	- monoid = associativity + identity element (simplest structure)
	- strings are monoids, thats why we cant subtract letters
	- monoids + inverse element = groups
	- (all these are discrete math and abstract algebra terms)

Self notes:
- knowledge graphs extract relationships and entities (objects jinke beech me r/ship) from data corpus, then we create KG embeddings
- can use these KG embeddings to do link prediction, KG visualization, 
- can use graph neural networks for graph classification, 


**Using ziro tutor:

- We donâ€™t need the chatbot to be contextual to the project/code opened, it answers any and all questions asked.
- I learnt about where to start with knowledge graphs. Was
- told me n degree polynomial will have n roots in complex system (including multiplicity, that is same root repeated)
- told me that even n will have roots with complex conjugate pairs and remaining real roots, no matter how many they be.
