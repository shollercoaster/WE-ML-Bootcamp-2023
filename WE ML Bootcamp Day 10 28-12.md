# Feminism in Science
- Add women in Science and stir, will it solve the problem?
	- No because there have always been women in Science, they've just not been recognised.
- "Border Discipline": An analysis of women and feminist science and Technology

### Ancient Science
#### Woman is not a rational Animal: Aristotle's views on the Biology of Gender
- He had credible opinions in other disciplines, which allowed many to get away with such regressive views.
- Applied natural laws in fish to human sciences.
- Defined slavery by saying its natural, and for a social order to be just, it should reflect what is natural.

### Modern Science
#### Sexing the X
- X is in all human bodies, males have XY, is Y the male chromosome?
- Synecdochic error: Calling Testosterone the 'male hormone', confusing the part for the whole and vice versa

#### Simone de Beauvoir
- One isn't born, yet rather _becomes_ a woman by the way everyone tells us to grow up, and act a certain way
- This is what's bad with **objectification**: Certain aspects of your body, your hormones, stop you from becoming someone. Because objects can't change. Subjects can.
- Can think about this as separating sex from gender.

#### Donna Haraway
- The God Trick: saying "I'm not being political, I'm just following the scientific method. I'm God, I'm just applying the rules."
- The solution: Partial perspectives, I know where you're standing and I know what you can't see, even when you're supposed to see everything.
- Knowledge is situated at the margins, in the partial perspectives.

### Tech is gendered
- It aligns with society's gendered views
- It defines some views to be inferior because of their biological composition
- The gender problem is not a 'deficit in women', but a problem with how its gendered.
- Data collection should be feminist, because "Predictive models may introduce or reinforce biases implicit in the data".
- Biological composition cannot ONLY explain someone's social and cultural standing
- Catherine D'Ignazio, Lauren Klein, Data Feminism
- Klinefelter (XXY) and Turner syndrome (1 X chromosome missing in women)
- "I'd say Cinderella is a pretty strong character, but her traits aren't seen as strength because strength is pretty gendered too." - Isha
